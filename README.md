## Abstract

Pseudogenes are regarded as “junk” DNA, representing vestigial functions no longer needed for fitness. Accordingly, higher number of pseudogenes in a bacterial human pathogen were previously hypothesized to be a hallmark of host specialists. In this study, we tested this hypothesis on the emergent bacterial plant pathogen *Xylella fastidiosa (Xf)* to link pseudogene makeup and host specificity. *Xf* is an ideal subject for these studies by being a xylem-limited pathogen that underwent extensive genome reduction. Using natural host range data of 151 strains and Pseudofinder analysis on *Xf* whole genome sequences, we observed that *Xf* subsp. *sandyi* had the highest pseudogene content followed by subsp. *morus* and *pauca*, while subsp. *fastidiosa* and *multiplex* had the lowest. The first two subspecies are known to have a limited host range compared to the others, aligning with the hypothesis of greater number of pseudogenes corresponding to narrower host range. Weed isolates are presumably host specialists since they had the highest pseudogene content. Using a thorough pseudogene map across genomes and empirical pathogenicity data on blueberries, we screened for genes potentially involved in blueberry specialization. Targets were identified by selecting sequences pseudogenized: i) in strains infecting hosts different than blueberry; and ii) only in blueberry asymptomatic strains. Nine sequences were identified with a potential role in blueberry infection, including one that was common between the two criteria. Here we generated hypotheses on host range and specificity of *Xf* strains that need to be tested experimentally to help understand this devastating plant pathogen.
